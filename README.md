## 📝 Introduction

Yoruba proverbs are rich in cultural and linguistic meaning. Automating their detection is challenging due to limited annotated data. **OWE-YOR** uses Transformer-based models like **AfroLM** and **mBERT** to capture semantic and contextual subtleties, outperforming traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes.  

**Goals of this project:**  
- Build an automated Yoruba proverb detection system ✅  
- Compare traditional ML and Transformer-based approaches ⚡  
- Contribute to AI tools for African languages 🌍  

---

## ✨ Features

- Detects Yoruba proverbs vs. non-proverbs  
- Uses **Transformer-based models** for high accuracy  
- Provides a **Streamlit demo** for interactive testing  
- Easily extensible to other low-resource African languages

## 📂 Dataset

- **Proverbs:** labeled `1`  
- **Non-proverbs:** labeled `0`  
- Data is **cleaned and preprocessed** for optimal training.

## 🤖 Models

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** – baseline performance  
- **AfroLM** and **mBERT** – Transformer-based classification  

**Performance Comparison Example:**  

| Model                   | Accuracy |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | 85%     |
| AfroLM / mBERT          | 92–95%  |

> Transformers better capture semantic context in Yoruba proverbs 🌟
